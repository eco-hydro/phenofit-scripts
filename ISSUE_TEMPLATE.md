- 1. 这里是解决`phenofit`bug的地方，不负责R语言基础内容的讲解。**如果你想问phenofit如何使用？请移步`stackoverflow`或者`知乎`。**

- 2. 想要问题快速得到解决，请提供你的输入数据、你的代码，可重现的bug，建议使用[`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)，

Please include a minimal reprex. The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that I can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading <https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex>, and follow the advice further down the page. Do NOT include session info unless it's explicitly asked for, or you've used `reprex::reprex(..., si = TRUE)` to hide it away.  

Delete these instructions once you have read them.

# insert reprex here

sessionInfo() # your sessionInfo, which version of phenofit are you using?
```
